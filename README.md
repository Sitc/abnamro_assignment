# Home Assignment
```
I choose Vue3 to create this project since likely this is what I will work with if I get hired.
I would like to emphasise that this is the first Vue3 app I created.It is a lot of fun but of course, in this limited amount of time, I can not optimize it as I would otherwise.

Also, I ran into a few unexpected issues with ‘emit’ which led me to not break down **HomePage.vue** as much as I planned.
