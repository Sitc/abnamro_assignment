# Home Assignment
```
I choose Vue3 to create this project since likely this is what I will work with if I get hired.
I would like to emphasise that this is the first Vue3 app I created.
It is a lot of fun but of course, in this limited amount of time, 
I can not optimize it as I would otherwise.

 - I use Vue3 with a mix of new technologies Composition/Option API.
 - VueX for simple state management.
 - Typescript

Also, I ran into a few unexpected issues which in a work situation 
I would discuss with my colleges.

I hope this project and my commits represents my dedication, curiosity and problem solving skills.
